# README
This is the official GitHub repository containing supplementary material for the Master's Thesis of Dominik Schaefer.

**Contents:**
- The file *final_meta_dataset* contains the final meta-dataset described in the Master's Thesis.

- The directory *raw_process_data* contains the nine original *.csv* files of the nine business processes extracted from System Alpha.

- The directory *python_scripts* contains the Python code used to build and analyse the meta-dataset.

**Disclaimer:**
The included Python code in the *python_scripts* directory was modified to exclude sensitive information related to the cooperating company and internal data structures. Additionally, the Python code is not optimised in terms of efficiency, but it reflects the explorative nature of this research. Thus, it can include intermediate results or multiple functions that have not been consolidated, allowing for the discussion of intermediate results.
